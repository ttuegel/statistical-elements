Radial Velocity of Galaxy NGC7531

SUMMARY:
       The galaxy data frame records the  radial  velocity  of  a
       spiral  galaxy  measured  at 323 points in the area of sky
       which it covers.  All the measurements  lie  within  seven
       slots  crossing at the origin.  The positions of the meas-
       urements given by four variables (columns).

DATA DESCRIPTION:
east.west:     the east-west coordinate.  The origin,  (0,0),  is
       near  the  center of the galaxy, east is negative, west is
       positive.
north.south:   the north-south coordinate.  The origin, (0,0), is
       near the center of the galaxy, south is negative, north is
       positive.
angle:    degrees of counter-clockwise rotation from the horizon-
       tal of the slot within which the observation lies.
radial.position:    signed  distance  from  origin;  negative  if
       east-west coordinate is negative.
velocity:   radial velocity measured in km/sec.
